## Tech talk

The game is made with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs)'s new app router approach. Most of the components are Server Components and the state is kept in cookies. Whenever you click a column a server action updates the state cookie and the game updates itself.

The styling is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
